We often think about what we can actually eat when we get home from work. Most of the time we can't think of anything, so I thought it would be a good idea to get inspired by recipes and combine that with practicing React :)

That's how the app came about in a one-day project. The mechanics are based on the well known tinder swipe idea. 

Code & layout by me.
